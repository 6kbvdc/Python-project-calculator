Description
A Python-based scientific calculator that supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical functions, constants, and parentheses. It runs in a command-line interface and allows switching between degrees and radians for trigonometric calculations.
Problem Solved
Traditional calculators are physical and limited to manual use. This project provides a digital calculator that can handle complex expressions, trigonometry, logarithms, powers, and factorials with immediate results.
Features
Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, **
Advanced functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sqrt, log, ln, factorial
Constants: pi, e
Nested parentheses
Switch between degrees and radians for trig functions
Command-line interface for quick calculations
Type exit to quit
How to Run
Save the code as calculator.py.
Open Python 3 or Pydroid 3.
Run the program:
Copy code

python calculator.py
Enter mathematical expressions to calculate results.
Type mode to toggle between degrees and radians.
Type exit to close the calculator.
