FX 82 Python Calculator


Description:
This project is a command line scientific calculator built with Python. It evaluates mathematical expressions and supports arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and factorials. Users switch between degrees and radians for angle calculations.


Problem:
Physical calculators limit flexibility and complex expressions. I built a software calculator to handle long formulas, nested parentheses, and scientific functions fast.


Features:
• Arithmetic, +, -, *, /, %, **
• Trigonometric functions, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
• sqrt, log, ln, factorial
• Constants, pi, e
• Nested parentheses
• Switch between degrees and radians
• Interactive command line interface
• Type exit to quit



Tools:
• Python 3
• math library


How to run:
• Install Python 3 or Pydroid 3
• Save file as calculator.py
• Run python calculator.py
• Enter expressions in the prompt

Example
• 2 + 3*4 returns 14
• sqrt(16) + sin(30) returns 4.5
• factorial(5) returns 120


What I learned:
• Expression parsing
• Working with the math module
• Handling user input
• Error handling
• Building interactive CLI tools


How I used AI:
I used ChatGPT as a learning assistant to understand syntax, debug errors, and improve code structure. I designed and implemented the application myself.
