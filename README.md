Project Title
FX 82 Scientific Calculator Simulator in Python
Description
This project is a Python based simulator of the Casio FX 82 scientific calculator. It replicates common scientific calculator functions in software and allows users to perform fast and accurate mathematical computations from the command line. I built it to practice implementing real world tools using code and to strengthen my problem solving and logic design skills.
Problem Solved
Students often rely on physical calculators for scientific operations. This project recreates those features digitally and automates calculations with consistent accuracy. It demonstrates how software can replace and extend hardware tools.
Features
Basic arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Powers and roots
Trigonometric functions, sin, cos, tan
Logarithms and exponentials
Factorials and scientific functions
Error handling for invalid input
Menu driven interface similar to a real calculator
Tools Used
Python 3
Math library
How to Run
Install Python 3
Download the project files
Open terminal in the project folder
Run python calculator.py
Program Structure
The program uses functions for each operation and a control loop to process user input. This structure keeps the code modular, readable, and easy to extend with new features.
What I Learned
Translating a physical device into software logic
Writing modular functions
Handling user input safely
Debugging calculation errors
Designing clear program flow
Future Improvements
Graphical user interface
Expression based input
Calculation history
Memory functions like a real FX 82
